# ErgoMonitor

ErgoMonitor sprang from a unique collaboration between myself, [Protoncracker](https://github.com/Protoncracker), and [SamuelSchutz13](https://github.com/SamuelSchutz13). My ambition was to craft a tool that acts as both a daily health-lookup for users and a robust assistant for professionals needing tools and detailed analytics. SamuelSchutz13, meanwhile, was developing a monitoring solution to streamline and perfect his own workflow. Discovering the complementary nature of our projects, we decided to merge them, creating a tool greater than the sum of its parts.

The essence of the name "ErgoMonitor" combines thoughtful design with practical function. "Ergo," with its roots in Latin, suggests a logical progression — "therefore" or "hence" — embodying the tool's foundational principle of deriving actionable insights through logical analysis. This term, often associated with reasoning and causality, reflects our aim for a tool that not only monitors but interprets and advises based on the data it observes. The "Monitor" component straightforwardly points to the application's core functionality: vigilant oversight of system performance and security.

Thus, ErgoMonitor is more than its name — it's a testament to our goal of delivering a monitoring solution that empowers users with clarity, foresight, and control over their digital environments, seamlessly blending the wisdom of traditional logic with the needs of modern technology.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**: Follow the setup instructions in the `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` to prepare your development environment. This ensures that you can build and test ErgoMonitor locally.

3. **Choose Your Contribution**: Decide whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation. If you're adding a new feature or making significant changes, it's wise to discuss it with the community or maintainers first.

4. **Create a New Branch**: Work on your contribution in a new branch named after the feature or fix you're implementing. This keeps your changes organized and simplifies the pull request process.

5. **Implement Your Changes**: With everything set up, start coding. Keep your changes concise and focused on the issue at hand. Remember to adhere to the coding standards mentioned in the project's contribution guidelines.

6. **Write or Update Tests**: If your changes involve code, ensure you add or update tests to cover the new functionality or fixes. This helps maintain ErgoMonitor's stability and reliability.

7. **Document Your Changes**: Update the documentation to reflect your changes or add new documentation as needed. Clear documentation ensures users and developers can make the most of ErgoMonitor.

8. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Once your changes are complete, submit them through a PR against the ErgoMonitor main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes and any additional context needed to understand your contribution.

### Contribution Review Process

Once your PR is submitted, it enters the review process:

- **Preliminary Review**: The core team will conduct a preliminary review to ensure your contribution aligns with the project's goals and guidelines.
  
- **Feedback Loop**: You may receive feedback requesting changes or further details. This is a normal part of the process, aimed at ensuring the highest quality and consistency of the project.

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

This section delves into common challenges and inquiries users may encounter while using ErgoMonitor, offering detailed solutions and troubleshooting steps. For an exhaustive compilation of questions and answers, please consult our [FAQ.md](./FAQ.md) document.

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. ErgoMonitor Fails to Start

- **Solution**: Begin by verifying the installation of all required dependencies. Re-run the installation commands to ensure nothing was missed. Check that your Python environment is compatible with the version required by ErgoMonitor. Inspect the `logs/` directory for any error messages that could indicate the problem. If errors are related to missing modules or libraries, installing them via pip may resolve the issue.

#### 2. Network Monitoring Not Working

- **Solution**: Ensure ErgoMonitor has the correct permissions to monitor network interfaces. Some systems may require running the application with administrative rights (e.g., using `sudo` on Linux). Verify the network interface configurations in the `network.config.json` file within the `configs/` directory are accurate and match your system's network setup. If changes were made, restart ErgoMonitor for them to take effect.

#### 3. High CPU Usage

- **Solution**: Adjusting the monitoring frequency in the `core.main.json` configuration file can help mitigate high CPU usage. Look for settings related to scan intervals and reduce their frequency. For users with custom extensions or scripts, ensure there are no inefficient loops or resource-intensive operations running unchecked. Profiling tools can help identify hotspots in custom code.

#### 4. Alerts Not Being Received

- **Solution**: Double-check the configuration of your notification settings in the `terminal.main.json` or relevant configuration files. Verify that any external communication services (e.g., email servers, webhook endpoints) are correctly set up and operational. Network connectivity issues can also interfere with sending alerts, so ensure your internet connection is stable.

#### 5. Incorrect Locale or Timezone Settings

- **Solution**: The `core.locale.json` file within the `configs/` directory allows you to specify locale and timezone settings. Ensure these are correctly configured to match your geographical location and system settings. Misconfigurations here can lead to incorrect timestamps in logs or data misinterpretation.

#### 6. Custom Extensions or Plugins Not Loading

- **Solution**: Confirm compatibility of your custom extensions or plugins with the current version of ErgoMonitor. Review the documentation for any specific requirements or dependencies that must be met. The ErgoMonitor log files can offer insights into why an extension or plugin failed to load, including missing dependencies or conflicts with existing modules.

#### 7. Difficulty Connecting to External APIs

- **Solution**: If ErgoMonitor is experiencing issues connecting to external APIs, check your firewall and internet settings to ensure outbound connections are allowed. Verify the API keys and configuration settings in the `external_communicator.py` file or respective configuration sections are correct. API providers may have updated their endpoints or authentication methods, so ensure your settings are up-to-date.

#### 8. Upgrades Resulting in Configuration Errors

- **Solution**: After upgrading ErgoMonitor, it's possible for configuration files to become incompatible. Compare your configuration files with the latest examples provided in the repository. Make necessary adjustments to align with new or changed settings. Backing up your configuration files before performing an upgrade is recommended to safeguard custom settings.

### General Troubleshooting Tips

- **Log Analysis**: The `logs/` directory is an excellent resource for troubleshooting. Look for error messages or warnings that might indicate what's wrong.
- **Update ErgoMonitor**: Ensure you're running the latest version of ErgoMonitor. Updates often contain bug fixes and performance improvements.
- **Community Support**: The ErgoMonitor community is a great resource. Use forums, chat channels, or the issue tracker to seek advice or share solutions.
