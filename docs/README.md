This doc shall include sections on installation, usage, contributing, and licensing, along with links to other important documentation. The README is often the first document potential users and contributors encounter, so it should be clear, concise, and compelling. This view, different from the README.md at root, shall get a more detailed description of the project and its surroundings.
