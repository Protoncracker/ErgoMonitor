The changelog should chronicle all the changes made to the project over time, including new features, bug fixes, and improvements. Entries should be organized by version in reverse chronological order, with clear descriptions of each change, the date of the change, and the version number. We shall create a typical pattern of entries to the changelog and only keep it by version and not by update.
